This past summer, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in RAGBRAI 2022, the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa. For those who may not be familiar, RAGBRAI is a week-long bicycle ride across the state of Iowa, and it’s the oldest, largest, and longest recreational bicycle touring event in the world. Covering approximately 462 miles over the course of seven days, the journey was both challenging and rewarding.

### The Journey Begins

Starting in Sergeant Bluff, I joined thousands of other enthusiastic cyclists. The sense of community was palpable from the very beginning. As we pedaled our way across Iowa, we passed through picturesque small towns, each offering unique hospitality and local charm. The camaraderie among riders and the welcoming spirit of the locals made every mile memorable.

One of the highlights was the overnight stops in towns like Carroll and Charles City. These towns went above and beyond to accommodate and entertain us. From live music and local food stalls to historical tours, each stop was a mini celebration of Iowa’s culture and community spirit.

Of course, the ride was not without its challenges. The summer heat was intense, and there were moments when the open stretches of road seemed endless. However, the support from fellow riders and the cheering crowds at each town kept my spirits high. Hydration and nutrition were key, and I made sure to take advantage of the numerous food and water stops along the route.

Reaching the Mississippi River in Lansing was an indescribable feeling. The sense of accomplishment and the collective joy of all the riders made the long journey worth every pedal stroke. Dunking my bike’s front tire in the Mississippi was a symbolic and satisfying end to an incredible adventure.

Participating in RAGBRAI 2022 was a life-changing experience that I’ll cherish forever. It wasn’t just about the ride; it was about the people, the stories, and the shared passion for cycling and adventure. I’m already looking forward to next year’s ride!
