On July 4, 2021, I embarked on an unforgettable cycling journey from Mile Marker 0 in Key West to Mile Marker 100 in Key Largo. This adventure combined my love for cycling with the stunning scenery of the Florida Keys, making for a truly memorable Independence Day.

### Starting at Mile Marker 0

My journey began at the iconic Mile Marker 0 in Key West. The excitement was palpable as I set off early in the morning to beat the heat. The streets of Key West were quiet, and the sunrise over the Atlantic Ocean provided a beautiful backdrop for the start of my ride.

The ride through the Florida Keys was nothing short of spectacular. The Overseas Highway, with its stunning views of the turquoise waters, offered a unique cycling experience. The route took me over numerous bridges, including the famous Seven Mile Bridge, which was a highlight of the trip. The combination of the ocean breeze and the picturesque scenery made the miles fly by.

At the midway point, I took a break in Marathon to refuel and hydrate. The locals were friendly, and I enjoyed a quick meal while taking in the beautiful surroundings. The support from fellow travelers and residents was encouraging, and it kept my spirits high for the second half of the journey.
