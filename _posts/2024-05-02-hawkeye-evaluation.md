### Introduction
This project at UNCW aims to evaluate the efficacy of the HawkEye satellite sensor in capturing ocean color (OC) imagery, particularly focusing on the Cape Fear River Estuary (CFRE) in southeastern North Carolina. Coastal and estuarine environments, vital for biodiversity and local economies, often present challenges for remote sensing due to their optically complex waters. This research undertakes detailed comparisons of in-situ measurements with data from HawkEye and other satellite sensors to refine and enhance marine conservation and management strategies.  

### Methodology
Our approach leverages a multi-platform strategy that combines HawkEye satellite data with an array of other satellite-derived and in-situ "sea-truthing" chlorophyll a measurements from the CFRE. This allows us to assess the accuracy and utility of HawkEye in estimating chlorophyll concentratwhich, which is crucial for understanding estuarine dynamics.

The utilization of a 3D in-situ dataset for satellite matchup analysis can bolster the satellite analysis, since satellite sensors often provide a surface level perspective which can limit understanding of the vertical variations within water bodies. Our 3D approach captures data across different depths, providing a more comprehensive view that is essential for accurately interpreting satellite imagery. This depth-resolved data enables enhanced calibration and validation of satellite sensors, leading to improved accuracy in mapping and monitoring aquatic environments. The 3D dataset not only aids in understanding the spatial distribution of water quality parameters but also supports the development of models that predict ecological changes within these complex systems.  

### Results
Preliminary analysis shows that HawkEye's high-resolution sensors provide superior clarity and detail in OC data compared to traditional satellite systems. The data correlated well with in-situ measurements, particularly in areas closer to river discharges where sediment concentration changes rapidly. Enhanced imaging capabilities have allowed for more accurate detection of algal blooms and sediment plumes, critical for timely environmental response.

### Implications
The findings from this study underscore the potential of advanced satellite sensors like HawkEye in improving our understanding of complex coastal waters. By providing more accurate and timely data, HawkEye can significantly aid in the management and conservation of aquatic resources. Further research will focus on integrating these insights into broader marine management practices.
