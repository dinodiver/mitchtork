## Introduction
I had the invaluable opportunity to join Dr. John Schallesâ€™s research team as an assistant on Sapelo Island, Georgia. Our primary objective was to map the distribution and health of Spartina alterniflora, a foundational species of salt marshes along the East Coast of the United States, and to estimate its biomass to better understand its ecological contributions.

## Project Background
Spartina alterniflora, commonly known as smooth cordgrass, dominates the low marsh areas of East Coast salt marshes. Its ecological significance is profound, providing critical erosion control, improving water quality, and offering essential habitat for diverse wildlife. Accurate mapping and biomass estimation are crucial for conservation efforts and understanding the impacts of environmental changes.

## Methodology
Our approach combined conventional remote sensing with innovative aerial drone surveys and direct biomass estimation:
- **Landsat Imagery:** We utilized Landsat 8 satellite data to get broad, regional snapshots of the marshlands. This long-standing dataset allowed us to examine changes over time and assess large-scale ecological trends.
- **Drone Flights:** For higher-resolution data, we conducted drone flights equipped with a multispectral sensor.
- **Biomass Estimation:** To ground-truth our remote sensing data and gain direct ecological measurements, we conducted biomass sampling. This involved clipping Spartina plants within designated plots, drying them in a lab to remove all moisture, and weighing the dried samples. This process helped us quantify the biomass and validate the health assessments derived from our imagery.

## Findings and Impact
Our integrated methodology revealed not only spatial and temporal trends in Spartina coverage but also provided concrete data on its biomass. This dataset will be crucial for the ongoing analysis.

## Conclusion
Working with Dr. Schalles and the team on this comprehensive project sharpened my skills in both high-tech remote sensing and fundamental ecological field methods. It underscored the importance of multi-faceted research approaches in environmental science.
