This summer, I had the pleasure of participating in RAGBRAI 2023, the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa. This event continues to be the oldest, largest, and longest recreational bicycle touring event in the world. Covering approximately 500 miles over the course of seven days, this year's journey presented new challenges and unforgettable experiences.

### The Journey Begins

We kicked off in Sioux City, where the excitement was palpable among thousands of riders. As we rode through Iowa, the picturesque small towns greeted us with their unique hospitality and charm. The camaraderie among cyclists and the warm welcome from the local communities made each mile a delight.

### Highlights of the Ride

This year, the overnight stops in towns such as Ames and Coralville stood out. These towns transformed into hubs of activity and entertainment, offering live music, delicious local food, and fascinating historical tours. Each stop was a celebration of Iowa's rich culture and community spirit.

### The Challenge

Riding across Iowa is never without its challenges. The summer heat was intense, and some stretches of the road seemed to go on forever. Yet, the support from fellow riders and the enthusiastic crowds at each town fueled my determination. Staying hydrated and well-nourished was crucial, and I took full advantage of the numerous food and water stops along the way.

### The Route

### The Finish Line

The ride culminated at the Mississippi River in Davenport, where I experienced an overwhelming sense of achievement. The shared joy and sense of accomplishment among all riders were palpable. Dunking my bike’s front tire in the Mississippi was a symbolic and rewarding end to this extraordinary adventure.
