## Introduction
I interned at the Coral Restoration Foundation (CRF) in Key Largo, Florida, a leader in active coral restoration. This opportunity allowed me to contribute directly to the conservation and restoration of coral reefs, which are among the most biologically diverse and economically valuable ecosystems on Earth.

## Experience Overview
Coral reefs are facing unprecedented threats from climate change, pollution, and overfishing. These threats have led to significant declines in coral health worldwide. At CRF, I was part of a team dedicated to developing and refining techniques for coral restoration, focusing on outplanting corals back into the wild to rebuild and rejuvenate degraded reef systems.

## Activities and Learning
Throughout my internship, my activities ranged from the nursery to the reef, each day packed with hands-on tasks and valuable lessons:
- **Off-Shore Nursery Work**: I learned how to care for and maintain different species of corals, particularly the endangered _Acropora cervicornis_ and _Acropora palmata_. Nursery duties involved cleaning and preparing coral fragments on PVC trees and monitoring their health and growth.
  
- **Outplanting Missions**: The most rewarding part of the internship was participating in outplanting missions. We would fragment healthy corals that had reached a suitable size in the nursery and then securely attach them to designated reef sites. This process not only required careful handling of the corals but also precise underwater skills to ensure successful transplantation.

- **Data Collection and Monitoring**: Post-outplanting, we conducted regular monitoring to assess the survival and integration of the corals into their new environments. Data collection involved measuring growth rates, assessing health, and documenting any signs of bleaching or disease.

- **Community Engagement and Education**: CRF places a strong emphasis on educating the public about coral reefs and the importance of their conservation. I participated in workshops and gave presentations to visitors, school groups, volunteers, and boy scouts at SeaBase High Adventure Camp, spreading awareness and fostering community involvement.

## Impact and Reflections
The hands-on experience significantly enhanced my understanding of marine biology and conservation practices. It provided me with a profound appreciation of the complexities involved in coral restoration and the innovative approaches being developed to address these challenges.
