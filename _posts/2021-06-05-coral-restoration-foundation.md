## Introduction
I interned at the [Coral Restoration Foundation (CRF)](https://www.coralrestoration.org/) in Key Largo, Florida, a leader in active coral restoration. This opportunity allowed me to contribute directly to the conservation and restoration of coral reefs, which are among the most biologically diverse and economically valuable ecosystems on Earth. Given the escalating threats from climate change and human activity, efforts like these are more crucial than ever.

## Mission Overview
Coral reefs are facing unprecedented threats from climate change, pollution, and overfishing. These threats have led to significant declines in coral health worldwide. At CRF, I was part of a team dedicated to developing and refining techniques for coral restoration, such as nurturing corals in nurseries and the use of photomosaics for reef health assessments, focusing on outplanting corals back into the wild to rebuild and rejuvenate degraded reef systems.

## Activities and Learning
Throughout my internship, my activities ranged from the nursery to the reef, each day packed with hands-on tasks and valuable lessons:

**Off-Shore Nursery Work:** I learned how to care for and maintain different species of corals, particularly the endangered *Acropora cervicornis* and *Acropora palmata*. Nursery duties involved cleaning and preparing coral fragments on PVC trees and monitoring their health and growth. Surges and overal unwieldy ocean conditions challenged me to refine my SCUBA peak performance buoyancy skills while performing tasks that required a steady, precise hand.

**Outplanting Missions:** The most rewarding part of the internship was participating in outplanting missions. We would fragment healthy corals that had reached a suitable size in the nursery and then securely attach them to designated reef sites, chosen based on criteria like water quality and existing marine life compatibility.

**Data Collection and Monitoring:** Post-outplanting, we conducted regular monitoring to assess the survival and integration of the corals into their new environments. Technologies such as underwater temperature sensors and photogrammetric surveys helped us measure growth rates, assess health, and document signs of bleaching or disease.

**Coral Collecting:** An integral part of our conservation efforts involved rescuing corals from underwater infrastructures like bridge pylons and cement bases scheduled for construction. This proactive rescue mission entailed carefully collecting these naturally settled corals and relocating them to our nursery. There, they were nurtured until they could be safely reintroduced to their natural reef habitats.

**Community Engagement and Education:** CRF places a strong emphasis on educating the public about coral reefs and the importance of their conservation. I participated in workshops and gave presentations to visitors, school groups, volunteers, and boy scouts at SeaBase High Adventure Camp, spreading awareness and fostering community involvement.

## Impact and Reflections
The hands-on experience significantly enhanced my understanding of marine biology and conservation practices. It provided me with a profound appreciation of the complexities involved in coral restoration and the innovative approaches being developed to address these challenges. This internship not only deepened my commitment to marine conservation but also shaped my career path towards advocating for and implementing sustainable marine environmental practices.
