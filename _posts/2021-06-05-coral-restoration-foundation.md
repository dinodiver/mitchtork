## Introduction
I interned at the [Coral Restoration Foundation (CRF)](https://www.coralrestoration.org/){:target="_blank"} in Key Largo, Florida, a leader in active coral restoration. This opportunity allowed me to contribute directly to the conservation and restoration of coral reefs, which are among the most biologically diverse and economically valuable ecosystems on Earth. Given the escalating threats from climate change and human activity, efforts like these are more crucial than ever.

## Mission Overview
Coral reefs are facing unprecedented threats from climate change, pollution, and overfishing. These threats have led to significant declines in coral health worldwide. At CRF, I was part of a team dedicated to developing and refining techniques for coral restoration, such as nurturing corals in nurseries and the use of photomosaics for reef health assessments, focusing on outplanting corals back into the wild to rebuild and rejuvenate degraded reef systems.

## Activities and Learning
Throughout my internship, my activities ranged from the nursery to the reef, each day packed with hands-on tasks and valuable lessons:

**Off-Shore Nursery Work:** I learned how to care for and maintain different species of corals, particularly the endangered *Acropora cervicornis* and *Acropora palmata*. Nursery duties involved cleaning and preparing coral fragments on PVC trees and monitoring their health and growth. Surges and overal unwieldy ocean conditions challenged me to refine my SCUBA peak performance buoyancy skills while performing tasks that required a steady, precise hand.

**Outplanting Missions:** The most rewarding part of the internship was participating in outplanting missions. We would fragment healthy corals that had reached a suitable size in the nursery and then securely attach them to designated reef sites, chosen based on criteria like water quality and existing marine life compatibility.

**Data Collection and Monitoring:** Post-outplanting, we conducted regular monitoring to assess the survival and integration of the corals into their new environments. Technologies such as underwater temperature sensors and photogrammetric surveys helped us measure growth rates, assess health, and document signs of bleaching or disease.

**Coral Collecting:** An integral part of our conservation efforts involved rescuing corals from underwater infrastructures like bridge pylons and cement bases scheduled for construction. This proactive rescue mission entailed carefully collecting these naturally settled corals and relocating them to our nursery. There, they were nurtured until they could be safely reintroduced to their natural reef habitats.

**Community Engagement and Education:** CRF places a strong emphasis on educating the public about coral reefs and the importance of their conservation. I participated in workshops and gave presentations to visitors, school groups, volunteers, and boy scouts at SeaBase High Adventure Camp, spreading awareness and fostering community involvement.

## Impact and Reflections
This hands-on experience profoundly enhanced my understanding of marine biology and conservation, deepening my appreciation for the complexities of coral restoration and the innovative approaches needed to tackle these challenges. The internship solidified my commitment to marine conservation and steered my career towards advocating for and implementing sustainable marine environmental practices.

## Additional Comments
During my time at CRF, I met Molly, a fellow intern (pink fin swimmer in the cover photo!). Our shared commitment to marine conservation quickly grew into a personal connection. After several years of dating and supporting each other through various endeavors and challenges, we recently got engaged! This milestone has deepened our dedication to the environmental causes we both share a passion for, underscoring that our journey is as much about the meaningful relationships we forge as it is about the work we undertake.
