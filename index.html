    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my personal space on the web. I'm Mitch Torkelson, a dedicated marine scientist and geospatial analyst, studying at the University of North Carolina-Wilmington, where I explore the vibrant and complex dynamics of ocean ecosystems. My passion for the marine world extends beyond research; I'm also a committed conservationist and an avid SCUBA diver.</p>
    
    <p>Originating from just north of Kansas City, Missouri, my journey began at Smithville High School where I was active in soccer, cross country, and track and field. My academic path led me to Creighton University in Omaha, NE, where I earned a B.S. in Biology with a minor in Environmental Science. The lure of the ocean took me abroad to the Galapagos Archipelago and later to the University of North Carolina-Wilmington for an M.S. in Marine Science, focusing on Ocean Color Remote Sensing.</p>
    
    <p>Professionally, my career has been diverse, ranging from analyzing satellite imagery to leading ecotours through the Everglades and Florida Coral Reefs. My role as a PADI Divemaster allows me to share the underwater wonders with others, enriching my experience and broadening my impact.</p>
    
    <p>I have presented my research at significant gatherings like the NC Water Resources Research Institute (WRRI) Annual Conference and the Center for Marine Science (CMS) Research Showcase. These experiences have honed my public speaking skills and fueled my enthusiasm for engaging with vital environmental issues.</p>
