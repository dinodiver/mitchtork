Hello! I'm Mitch Torkelson. Thrilled you've stopped by, I'm excited to share my passion for marine science and the extraordinary adventures that accompany it. This site mirrors my journey through both academia and the vast expanses of water across our planet.
    
Although my marine science journey began far from any ocean, at Creighton University in the heartland of America, it has propelled me to some of the most spectacular underwater sites around the world. My academic pursuits took me from the Galapagos Archipelago to Wilmington, where I'm progressing through a M.S. in Marine Science, specializing in Ocean Color Remote Sensing. Professionally, I've ranged from analyzing satellite imagery to leading ecotours through Florida's lush natural habitats, and engaging in groundbreaking research.

Beyond the ocean's depths, I relish the great outdoors—whether that's kayaking, hiking, or jogging through nature's trails. You can also find me relaxing with my hammock and book, or playing a game of chess. [Play a game with me!](https://www.chess.com/member/dinodiver4){:target="_blank"}.
