        <h2>HawkEye Evaluation</h2>

        <p>This project aims to evaluate the efficacy of the HawkEye satellite sensor in capturing ocean color (OC) imagery, focusing on the Cape Fear River Estuary (CFRE) in southeastern North Carolina. Despite the value of coastal and estuarine environments, their study via remote sensing is challenged by optically complex waters. By comparing in-situ measurements with HawkEye and other satellites' data, this research endeavors to enhance marine conservation and management strategies.</p>
