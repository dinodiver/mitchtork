# About Me

Welcome to my personal space on the web. I'm Mitch Torkelson, a marine scientist, geospatial analyst, and avid diver with a passion for understanding and preserving our oceanic ecosystems.

## My Journey

My academic path began at Smithville High School and led me to Creighton University, where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Biology, minoring in Environmental Science. My quest for knowledge took me to the Galapagos Archipelago for a study abroad program focused on Marine Biology, and later to the University of North Carolina Wilmington for an M.S. in Marine Science, specializing in Ocean Color Remote Sensing.

## Professional Endeavors

Professionally, I've worn many hats. As a Geospatial Analyst, I've harnessed the power of GIS to aid conservation efforts. My work as a Graduate Research Assistant allowed me to dive deep into coastal research, leveraging satellite imagery to investigate the mysteries of the Cape Fear River Estuary. Alongside my academic research, I've shared my knowledge and love for the underwater world as a Divemaster, guiding others through aquatic adventures.

## Conferences and Presentations

I've presented my research at various conferences, such as the NC Water Resources Research Institute (WRRI) Annual Conference and the CMS Research Showcase. These opportunities have not only honed my public speaking skills but also allowed me to contribute to important environmental conversations.

## Interests and Hobbies

When I'm not immersed in marine science or geospatial analysis, I enjoy a variety of activities that keep me engaged and active:

- **Conversational Spanish**: I love practicing my Spanish, improving my fluency and understanding of different cultures.
- **Running & cycling**: Whether it's a morning jog or ride to clear my mind or a competitive race, staying active is important to me.
- **Scuba Diving**: There's nothing quite like exploring the underwater world, a passion that complements my professional interests.
- **Cooking**: I find joy in experimenting with new recipes and flavors, it's like a science experiment with delicious results.
- **Swimming**: It's a great way to relax and stay fit, and feels quite natural as an extension of my love for water.
- **Chess**: Strategy and forethought in chess help me unwind and keep my mind sharp.
- **Hiking**: I'm an outdoors enthusiast, cherishing every opportunity to connect with nature.
