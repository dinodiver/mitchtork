# About Mitch Torkelson

Welcome to my personal space on the web. I'm Mitch Torkelson, a marine scientist, geospatial analyst, and avid diver with a passion for understanding and preserving our oceanic ecosystems.

## My Journey

My academic path began at Smithville High School and led me to Creighton University, where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Biology, minoring in Environmental Science. My quest for knowledge took me to the Galapagos Archipelago for a study abroad program focused on Marine Biology, and later to the University of North Carolina Wilmington for an M.S. in Marine Science, specializing in Ocean Color Remote Sensing.

## Professional Endeavors

Professionally, I've worn many hats. As a Geospatial Analyst, I've harnessed the power of GIS to aid conservation efforts. My work as a Graduate Research Assistant allowed me to dive deep into coastal research, leveraging satellite imagery to investigate the mysteries of the Cape Fear River Estuary. Alongside my academic research, I've shared my knowledge and love for the underwater world as a Divemaster, guiding others through aquatic adventures.

## Conferences and Presentations

I've presented my research at various conferences, such as the NC Water Resources Research Institute (WRRI) Annual Conference and the CMS Research Showcase. These opportunities have not only honed my public speaking skills but also allowed me to contribute to important environmental conversations.

## Interests and Hobbies

Beyond my professional life, I am a zealous advocate for sustainable living and a hobbyist photographer. I believe that every snapshot we take is a story to tell and a memory to preserve.

## Let's Connect

I'm always open to discussing potential collaborations, research opportunities, or just chatting about the latest in marine conservation. Feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope to connect with you soon!
